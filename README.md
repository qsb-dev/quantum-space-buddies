## Frequently Asked Questions

### Requirements
- Latest version of OWML.
- Latest version of Mod Manager. (If using)
- Latest version of Outer Wilds. **We cannot guarantee QSB, or OWML, will work on cracked/pirated versions of Outer Wilds. Do not come asking us for help when using pirated versions.**
- Fast and stable internet connection, upload and download.
- Above minimum Outer Wilds system requirements.

### How complete is this mod? How far through the game can I play?

The base game is around 95% supported.

Echoes of the Eye is not yet supported, but is nearly done.

### Compatibility with other mods
TL;DR - Don't use any mods with QSB that aren't marked as QSB compatible. 

QSB relies on object hierarchy to sync objects, so any mod that changes that risks breaking QSB. Also, QSB relies on certain game events being called when things happen in-game. Any mod that makes these things happen without calling the correct events will break QSB. Some mods will work fine and have been tested, like CrouchMod. Others may only work partly, like EnableDebugMode and TAICheat.

### Will you make this compatible with NomaiVR?

Maybe.

### Why do I keep getting thrown around the ship?

Boring boring physics stuff. The velocity of the ship is synced, as well as the angular velocity. However, this velocity is not also applied to the player. (Or it is sometimes. I don't 100% know.) This means the ship will accelerate, leaving the player "behind". Which makes you fly into the walls alot.

**Update**: you can attach/detach yourself to/from the ship using the prompt in the center of the screen.

### What's the difference between QSB and Outer Wilds Online?

TL;DR - QSB is multiplayer co-op, Outer Wilds Online is multiplayer not co-op.

QSB is a fully synced game. The other players are actually there in the world, and can affect things. The loop starts/ends at the same time for everyone, and you share ship logs / signal discoveries.

Outer Wilds Online is easier to set up, but much more basic in its features. The other players cannot affect your game, and do not contribute to anything in your save. The loop is entirely per-player.

### Why would someone make this mod? Seems like a lot of effort for no reward.

Good question.

Let me know if you find an answer.

**Update**: a plausible answer is the enjoyment you get seeing/hearing about others playing with their friends :) 

## Development Setup

- [Download the Outer Wilds Mod Manager](https://github.com/raicuparta/ow-mod-manager) and install it anywhere you like;
- Install OWML using the Mod Manager
- Clone QSB's source
- Open the file `DevEnv.targets` in your favorite text editor
- (optional if copying built dlls manually) Edit the entry `<OwmlDir>` to point to your OWML directory (it is installed inside the Mod Manager directory)
- (optional if no unity project) Edit the entry `<GameDir>` to point to the directory where Outer Wilds is installed
- (optional if no unity project) Edit the entry `<UnityAssetsDir>` to point to the Assets folder of the QSB unity project
- Open the project solution file `QSB.sln` in Visual Studio 2022

If developing with the Steam version of Outer Wilds you can't run multiple instances of the game by default. To do so, create a file called `steam_appid.txt` in your Outer Wilds directory and write `753640` inside it, then run the exe directly.

A powerful PC is needed for development, due to the high amount of RAM and CPU needed to run 2 or 3 instances of modded Outer Wilds.

It is also recommended to lower all graphics settings to minimum, be in windowed mode, and lower resolution to roughly a quarter of your monitor space. This lets you run multiple instances of Outer Wilds to quickly test QSB.

Some debugging options exist to make things easier. These come in the form of actions and settings.
### Debug Actions :

Hold Q and press :

- Numpad 1 - Teleport to nearest player.
- Numpad 2 - If holding LeftShift, warp to the dreamworld Vault fire. If not, warp to the Endless Canyon.
- Numpad 3 - Unlock the Sealed Vault.
- Numpad 4 - Damage the ship's electrical system.
- Numpad 5 - Trigger the supernova.
- Numpad 6 - Set the flags for having met Solanum and the Prisoner.
- Numpad 7 - Warp to the Vessel.
- Numpad 8 - Insert the Advanced Warp Core into the Vessel.
- Numpad 9 - If holding LeftShift, load the SolarSystem scene. If not, load the EyeOfTheUniverse scene.
- Numpad 0 - Revive a random dead player.

### Debug Settings :

Create a file called `debugsettings.json` in the mod folder.
The template for this file is this :

```
{
  "useKcpTransport": false,
  "dumpWorldObjects": false,
  "playerIdInLogs": false,
  "hookDebugLogs": false,
  "avoidTimeSync": false,
  "debugMode": false,
  "drawGui": false,
  "drawLines": false,
  "drawLabels": false,
  "drawQuantumVisibilityObjects": false,
  "skipTitleScreen": false,
  "greySkybox": false
}
```

- useKcpTransport - Allows you to directly connect to IP addresses, rather than use the Epic relay.
- dumpWorldObjects - Creates a file with information about the WorldObjects that were created.
- playerIdInLogs - Appends the player id to every log message sent.
- hookDebugLogs - Print Unity logs and warnings.
- avoidTimeSync - Disables the syncing of time.
- debugMode - Enables debug mode. If this is set to `false`, none of the following settings do anything.
- drawGui - Draws a GUI at the top of the screen that gives information on many things.
- drawLines - Draws gizmo-esque lines around things. Indicates reference sectors/transforms, triggers, etc. LAGGY.
- drawLabels - Draws GUI labels attached to some objects. LAGGY.
- drawQuantumVisibilityObjects - Indicates visibility objects with an orange shape.
- skipTitleScreen - Auto-skips the splash screen.
- greySkybox - Turns the skybox grey. Useful in the Eye, where it's pretty dark.

**Warning : Mod development can lead to unexpected errors in your computer system.** 
- **When editing the networking code, mistakes can lead to QSB overwhelming your network connection with excess packets**.
- **Too high RAM usage will lead to Outer Wilds sticking at ~31% loading, then crashing**.
- **There have been instances of graphics cards crashing, and needing to be disabled/re-enabled from Device Manager.**
